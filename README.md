The website https://globalchristians.org/espanol/ needs to be updated. There are still some sections in English and some obvious mistakes. 
It should be fast, responsive, written manily in html,css and javascript and geared toward Christian in Latin America. 
It should have an international feel. 
The new contact person (for the Contact form) should be: Altair tabita Campusano carvajal <altairtabitacampusanocarvajal@gmail.com> 
It is not the Antioch International Bible Institute any more it is under Cybermissions
